# Audiophile e-commerce website

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

**To do this challenge, you need a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript(React JS).**

## The challenge

The project is to build out this multi-page e-commerce website and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I used any tools that helped me complete this project. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

I can either use a JS-heavy approach, where local `data.json` file for the products is provided or take it up a notch, feel free to build this as a full-stack application or also use a headless CMS!

My users should be able to:o:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add/Remove products from the cart
- Edit product quantities in the cart
- Fill in all fields in the checkout
- Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during checkout
- See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart
  - Shipping always adds $50 to the order
  - VAT is calculated as 20% of the product total, excluding shipping
- See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary
- **Bonus**: Keep track of what's in the cart, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

## Deploying your project

As mentioned above, there are many ways to host your project for free. I recommended hosts are:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€

### React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

### Usage

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# start dev server
$ npm run dev

# build
$ npm run build

# build and watch for changes
$ npm run dev:build
```
